				The given data visualization is a simple heatmap of confirmed coronavirus cases in most of the world. Taken from a news article, it is best suited for the general public. While it does not have precise data, it is useful to give a quick understanding of what sections of the world are having large quantities of coronavirus cases. The heatmap utilizes spatial fields with ordinal ordered data for visualization. The different sized circles show differing intensity on a world map with the epicenter of the circles representing where the data comes from.

				The task for the data visualization is to compare the impact of coronavirus in parts of the world. It serves as a resource to gain a general idea of where the coronavirus is most felt. By using varying sizes of impact circles, the graphic is useful for quick glances to understand more severe areas. I believe this visualization is good for surface understanding, but falls short in the desire for more information. The varying circle sizes give a good comparison in relation to each other, but a key to give numerical data would give deeper understanding without inconveniencing the knowledge gleamed from just a glance.
